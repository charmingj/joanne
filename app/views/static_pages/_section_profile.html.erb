She was surrounded by a crowd of gentlemen and didn’t recognize my existing when I first saw her. I noticed she subconsciously kept distance to the man who is trying to get to know her. 
It comes to me that she was already with someone else. So I turned around, gave myself a hug, and walked into the rain. A few months passed, it was another BID dinner party. There she is, still surrounded with people. But this time, I could only see nothing but her. My heart is beating like a drum, I hold my breath and walked to her. Then the story between us began......
