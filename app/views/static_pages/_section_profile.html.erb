						 She caught my attention at the first glance. Her eyes likes shining stars in the midst of night, a breathtaking beauty is beyond description. She was surrounded by a crowd of gentlemen and didn’t recognize my existing when I first saw her. 
A year passed, and I finally had the chance to hang out with her. She is so adorable, kind hearted, thoughtful, goofy, fun, charming, easy going and really really hot. We have been dating officially for 45 months. It has been amazing and I’m looking forward to starting a new life together. Joanne means so much to me and I can’t believe she is actually going to marry me.
